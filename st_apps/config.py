SYSTEM_PROMPT = '''You are an AI language model designed to segment text extracted from images into coherent semantic chunks for information retrieval and Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) tasks. Each chunk should capture a single topic or idea, be contextually self-contained, and utilize natural topic boundaries and structural cues within the text, such as paragraphs or bullet points.'''
USER_PROMPT = '''Parse and divide the text from the attached image into coherent semantic chunks suitable for information retrieval. Ensure each chunk maintains semantic integrity by capturing a distinct topic or idea. Use natural breaks like paragraphs or sections as boundaries without altering or omitting any words.

Guidelines:
1. Preserve Contextual Boundaries:
   - Each chunk should represent a single coherent idea or topic. Use natural text breaks like paragraphs or sections as guides.
   - Place the chunk's text within the `<text>` XML tag.

2. Full Word Segmentation:
   - Do not split words between chunks. Adjust boundaries to include entire words only.

3. Optimal Chunk Length:
   - Aim for balanced lengths:
     - Shorter chunks (250-400 tokens) enhance retrieval precision.
     - Larger chunks (400-1000 tokens) provide more context for broader understanding.

4. Task-Specific Strategy:
   - Adjust chunk lengths based on the retrieval task:
     - Finer chunks are better for precise searches.
     - Broader chunks are suitable for summarization or narrative flows.
     - Make sure each chunk is at least 3 sentences and at most 25 sentences.

5. Boundary Indications:
   - If the first or last portion of the text continues from or to another page, mark the chunk to be merged.
   - Use the `<needs_merging>` XML tag with possible values: 'previous', 'next', or 'no_need'.

6. Contextual Summary:
   - Provide a short, succinct summary for each chunk to situate it within the overall document.
   - Place the summary within the `<chunk_summary>` XML tag.

7. Tables and Figures:
   - Create separate chunks for tables or figures.
   - Explain in detail what is presented in the table or figure.
   - Use `<table>` and `<figure>` XML tags for narrations.

8. Page and Section Numbers:
   - Include any page or section numbers found in the image within the metadata.
   - Use the `<page>` and `<section>` XML tags inside the `<metadata>` tag.

9. Metadata Inclusion:
   - Include metadata found in each chunk. Identify and report the following metadata:
     - Entities: Named entities mentioned in the chunk.
     - Topics: Main topics discussed in the chunk.
   - Use `<entities>` and `<topics>` XML tags inside the `<metadata>` tag.
   - Do not fabricate information; if none are found, leave the fields empty.

10. Search Queries:
    - If meaningful, provide typical concise search queries that the chunk's content can best answer.
    - If not applicable, leave the field empty.
    - Place the queries within the `<queries>` XML tag.

11. Final Output Format:
    The final output should be in the following XML format:

    ```xml
    <chunks>
      <c1>
        <text>[Actual chunk text]</text>
        <needs_merging>[previous | next | no_need]</needs_merging>
        <metadata>
          <entities>[Entities mentioned in the chunk]</entities>
          <topics>[Topics discussed in the chunk]</topics>
          <page>[Page number corresponding to the chunk if any]</page>
          <section>[Section number corresponding to the chunk if any]</section>
        </metadata>
        <table>[Concise narration of the table's contents, if any]</table>
        <figure>[Concise narration of the figure's contents, if any]</figure>
        <queries>[Typical search queries the chunk can best answer]</queries>
        <chunk_summary>[Contextual summary of the chunk]</chunk_summary>
      </c1>
      <!-- Repeat for each chunk -->
    </chunks>
    ```

    Notes:
    - Omit any XML tags that are not applicable to a chunk (e.g., `<table>` if there's no table).
    - Ensure all fields are accurate and solely based on the content found in the image.'''
